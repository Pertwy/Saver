Saving App

## Purpose
This app is designed to help users to save money by “not doing something”. i.e. when you choose not to buy a coffee in the morning, you would open the app and click 
a button to transfer the cost of that coffee into your savings account or to a charity.

## Inspiration
The origional inspiration for this application was Richard Thaler, in his bookk Nudge, and on the Micheal Lewis podcast Against The Rules. Thaler talks about samll changes/"Nudges" that can push people in the right direction without being overbearing. HE also speaks about "The Good Bank", which is an idealised sinario where banks remove features that some people would class as unfair. I see this app as a nudge to help people save for what they really want, instead of spending on what they don't need
