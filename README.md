# Saver
Saving App

This app is designed to help users to save money by “not doing something”. i.e. when you choose not to buy a coffee in the morning, you would open the app and click 
a button to transfer the cost of that coffee into your savings account or to a charity.

The app has been created using React Native, JS, CSS, Redux, and firebase.

As this is app to help people save money, I would like it to be completely free. This means that transactions will need to be free. This requires an application to use 
Open Banking. To increase the likelihood of the application being approved, I plan to first deploy the app using Stripe to transfer money. As Stripe charges a transfer 
fee (albeit a very small one) I will recommend to users that until the Open Banking application has been successful, that they should not use the transfer function in the app, 
and should instead use their usual online banking app to transfer money. This is a means to an end to ensure the final product is completely fit for purpose
